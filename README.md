# Vehicle-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning project that predicts vehicle prices based on features such as make, model, mileage, engine size, and age using Ridge, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
# üöó Vehicle Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the **price of vehicles** based on their specifications, including make, model, year, engine details, fuel type, and more. It utilizes machine learning regression algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to create a robust price prediction system.

## üéØ Objective
To develop a machine learning model capable of predicting **vehicle prices** using available data on vehicle features and specifications. The project explores data cleaning, feature extraction, and model optimization for accurate price estimation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant columns (`description`, `name`, `exterior_color`, `interior_color`)
- Extracted **engine displacement** from engine details (e.g., ‚Äú3.5L‚Äù ‚Üí 3.5)
- Replaced missing numerical values with **median** and categorical values with **mode**
- Derived **vehicle age** from the manufacturing year
- One-hot encoded categorical variables using `pd.get_dummies`
- Scaled numerical features with **StandardScaler**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized price distribution using histograms  
- Examined feature correlations using a heatmap  
- Created scatter and box plots:
  - Age vs. Price  
  - Price by Vehicle Make (Top 6 Manufacturers)  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
Trained and evaluated multiple regression models for performance comparison:

| Model | Description | Evaluation Metric |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Ridge Regression | Linear model with L2 regularization | MAE, RMSE, R¬≤ |
| Random Forest Regressor | Ensemble tree-based model | MAE, RMSE, R¬≤ |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor | Boosting model with GridSearchCV tuning | MAE, RMSE, R¬≤ |

Hyperparameter tuning performed with **GridSearchCV** to identify optimal model parameters.

## üìä Model Evaluation

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R¬≤ |
|--------|-----|------|----|
| Ridge Regression | ~2800 | ~3700 | 0.78 |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | ~2200 | ~3100 | **0.88** |
| Gradient Boosting (Tuned) | ~2100 | ~3000 | **0.90** |

*(Values are approximate and may vary based on data split and tuning.)*

Visualized **Actual vs Predicted Prices** for Gradient Boosting using a scatter plot.
